# CLI tools for generating histograms from log files

histo-log is a command line program for parsing log files and
generating histograms from the contents.

It's mostly a test-bed for learning rust for me, porting from an
existing ruby-based tool.

This is also an experiment in snap packaging for rust since debian
rust packaging seems beyond my ability to wrestle the dependencies.
